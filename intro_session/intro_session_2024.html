<h1>Variable assignment</h1>
<p>A basic concept in (statistical) programming is called a variable.</p>
<p>A variable allows you to store a value (e.g.&nbsp;4) or an object (e.g.&nbsp;a function description) in R. You can then later use this variable’s name to easily access the value or the object that is stored within this variable.</p>
<p>You can assign a value 4 to a variable my_var with the command</p>

<p>Apples and oranges</p>
<p>Common knowledge tells you not to add apples and oranges. But hey, that is what you just did, no :-)? The my_apples and my_oranges variables both contained a number in the previous exercise. The + operator works with numeric variables in R. If you really tried to add “apples” and “oranges”, and assigned a text value to the variable my_oranges (see the editor), you would be trying to assign the addition of a numeric and a character variable to the variable my_fruit.

<h1>Let us focus first!</h1>
<p>On your way from rags to riches, you will make extensive use of vectors. Vectors are one-dimension arrays that can hold numeric data, character data, or logical data. In other words, a vector is a simple tool to store data. For example, you can store your daily gains and losses in the casinos.</p>
<p>In R, you create a vector with the combine function c(). You place the vector elements separated by a comma between the parentheses. For example:</p>

<h1>Create a vector (3)</h1>
<p>After one week in Las Vegas and still zero Ferraris in your garage, you decide that it is time to start using your data analytical superpowers.</p>
<p>Before doing a first analysis, you decide to first collect all the winnings and losses for the last week:</p>
<p>For poker_vector:</p>
<pre><code>On Monday you won $140
Tuesday you lost $50
Wednesday you won $20
Thursday you lost $120
Friday you won $240</code></pre>
<p>For roulette_vector:</p>
<pre><code>On Monday you lost $24
Tuesday you lost $50
Wednesday you won $100
Thursday you lost $350
Friday you won $10</code></pre>
<p>You only played poker and roulette, since there was a delegation of mediums that occupied the craps tables. To be able to use this data in R, you decide to create the variables poker_vector and roulette_vector</p>

<p>If you want to become a good statistician, you have to become lazy. (If you are already lazy, chances are high you are one of those exceptional, natural-born statistical talents.)</p>
<p>In the previous exercises you probably experienced that it is boring and frustrating to type and retype information such as the days of the week. However, when you look at it from a higher perspective, there is a more efficient way to do this, namely, to assign the days of the week vector to a variable!</p>
<p>Just like you did with your poker and roulette returns, you can also create a variable that contains the days of the week. This way you can use and re-use it.</p>

<section id="calculating-total-winnings." class="level1">
<h1>Calculating total winnings.</h1>
<p>Now that you have the poker and roulette winnings nicely as named vectors, you can start doing some data analytical magic.</p>
<p>You want to find out the following type of information:</p>
<pre><code>How much has been your overall profit or loss per day of the week?
Have you lost money over the week in total?
Are you winning/losing money on poker or on roulette?</code></pre>
<p>To get the answers, you have to do arithmetic calculations on vectors.</p>
<p>It is important to know that if you sum two vectors in R, it takes the element-wise sum. For example, the following three statements are completely equivalent:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>[1] 5 7 9</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>[1] 5 7 9</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>[1] 5 7 9</code></pre>

</section>
<section id="calculating-total-winnings-2" class="level1">
<h1>Calculating total winnings (2)</h1>
<p>Now you understand how R does arithmetic with vectors, it is time to get those Ferraris in your garage! First, you need to understand what the overall profit or loss per day of the week was. The total daily profit is the sum of the profit/loss you realized on poker per day, and the profit/loss you realized on roulette per day.</p>
<p>In R, this is just the sum of roulette_vector and poker_vector</p>
<p>#Calculating total winnings (3)</p>
<p>Based on the previous analysis, it looks like you had a mix of good and bad days. This is not what your ego expected, and you wonder if there may be a very tiny chance you have lost money over the week in total?</p>
<p>A function that helps you to answer this question is sum(). It calculates the sum of all elements of a vector. For example, to calculate the total amount of money you have lost/won with poker you do:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>[1] -84</code></pre>
</div>

<section id="comparing-total-winnings" class="level1">
<h1>Comparing total winnings</h1>
<p>Oops, it seems like you are losing money. Time to rethink and adapt your strategy! This will require some deeper analysis…</p>
<p>After a short brainstorm in your hotel’s jacuzzi, you realize that a possible explanation might be that your skills in roulette are not as well developed as your skills in poker. So maybe your total gains in poker are higher (or &gt; ) than in roulette</p>

<p>Vector selection: the good times</p>
<p>Your hunch seemed to be right. It appears that the poker game is more your cup of tea than roulette.</p>
<p>Another possible route for investigation is your performance at the beginning of the working week compared to the end of it. You did have a couple of Margarita cocktails at the end of the week…</p>
<p>To answer that question, you only want to focus on a selection of the total_vector. In other words, our goal is to select specific elements of the vector. To select elements of a vector (and later matrices, data frames, …), you can use square brackets. Between the square brackets, you indicate what elements to select. For example, to select the first element of the vector, you type poker_vector[1]. To select the second element of the vector, you type poker_vector[2], etc. Notice that the first element in a vector has index 1, not 0 as in many other programming languages.</p>

<section id="great-r-also-makes-it-possible-to-select-multiple-elements-from-a-vector-at-once.-learn-how-in-the-next-exercise" class="level1">
<h1>Great! R also makes it possible to select multiple elements from a vector at once. Learn how in the next exercise!</h1>
<p>Vector selection: the good times (2)</p>
<p>How about analyzing your midweek results?</p>
<p>To select multiple elements from a vector, you can add square brackets at the end of it. You can indicate between the brackets what elements should be selected. For example: suppose you want to select the first and the fifth day of the week: use the vector c(1, 5) between the square brackets. For example, the code below selects the first and fifth element of poker_vector:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>Monday Friday 
   140    240 </code></pre>

<h1>Well done! Continue to the next exercise to specialize in vector selection some more!</h1>
<p>Vector selection: the good times (3)</p>
<p>Selecting multiple elements of poker_vector with c(2, 3, 4) is not very convenient. Many statisticians are lazy people by nature, so they created an easier way to do this: c(2, 3, 4) can be abbreviated to 2:4, which generates a vector with all natural numbers from 2 up to 4.</p>
<p>So, another way to find the mid-week results is poker_vector[2:4]. Notice how the vector 2:4 is placed between the square brackets to select element 2 up to 4.</p>

<section id="awesome-the-colon-operator-is-extremely-useful-and-very-often-used-in-r-programming-so-remember-it-well.-proceed-to-the-next-exercise." class="level1">
<h1>Awesome! The colon operator is extremely useful and very often used in R programming, so remember it well. Proceed to the next exercise.</h1>
<p>Vector selection: the good times (4)</p>
<p>Another way to tackle the previous exercise is by using the names of the vector elements (Monday, Tuesday, …) instead of their numeric positions. For example,</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>Monday 
   140 </code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</section>
<section id="will-select-the-first-element-of-poker_vector-since-monday-is-the-name-of-that-first-element." class="level1">
<h1>will select the first element of poker_vector since “Monday” is the name of that first element.</h1>
<p>Just like you did in the previous exercise with numerics, you can also use the element names to select multiple elements, for example:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code> Monday Tuesday 
    140     -50 </code></pre>
</div>

<section id="good-job-apart-from-subsetting-vectors-by-index-or-by-name-you-can-also-subset-vectors-by-comparison.-the-next-exercises-will-show-you-how" class="level1">
<h1>Good job! Apart from subsetting vectors by index or by name, you can also subset vectors by comparison. The next exercises will show you how!</h1>
<p>Selection by comparison - Step 1</p>
<p>By making use of comparison operators, we can approach the previous question in a more proactive way.</p>
<p>The (logical) comparison operators known to R are:</p>
<pre><code>&lt; for less than
&gt; for greater than
&lt;= for less than or equal to
&gt;= for greater than or equal to
== for equal to each other
!= not equal to each other</code></pre>
<p>As seen in the previous chapter, stating 6 &gt; 5 returns TRUE. The nice thing about R is that you can use these comparison operators also on vectors. For example:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>[1] FALSE FALSE  TRUE</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</section>
<section id="this-command-tests-for-every-element-of-the-vector-if-the-condition-stated-by-the-comparison-operator-is-true-or-false" class="level1">
<h1>This command tests for every element of the vector if the condition stated by the comparison operator is TRUE or FALSE</h1>
<div class="cell">
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>   Monday   Tuesday Wednesday  Thursday    Friday 
     TRUE     FALSE      TRUE     FALSE      TRUE </code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</section>
<section id="selection-by-comparison---step-2" class="level1">
<h1>Selection by comparison - Step 2</h1>
<p>Working with comparisons will make your data analytical life easier. Instead of selecting a subset of days to investigate yourself (like before), you can simply ask R to return only those days where you realized a positive return for poker.</p>
<p>In the previous exercises you used selection_vector &lt;- poker_vector &gt; 0 to find the days on which you had a positive poker return. Now, you would like to know not only the days on which you won, but also how much you won on those days.</p>
<p>You can select the desired elements, by putting selection_vector between the square brackets that follow poker_vector:</p>
<p>poker_vector[selection_vector]</p>
<p>R knows what to do when you pass a logical vector in square brackets: it will only select the elements that correspond to TRUE in selection_vector</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="whats-a-matrix">What’s a matrix?</h2>
<p>In R, a matrix is a collection of elements of the same data type (numeric, character, or logical) arranged into a fixed number of rows and columns. Since you are only working with rows and columns, a matrix is called two-dimensional.</p>
<p>You can construct a matrix in R with the matrix() function. Consider the following example:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>     [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]    1    2    3
[2,]    4    5    6
[3,]    7    8    9</code></pre>

<section id="in-the-matrix-function" class="level1">
<h1>In the matrix() function:</h1>
<pre><code>The first argument is the collection of elements that R will arrange into the rows and columns of the matrix. Here, we use 1:9 which is a shortcut for c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).
The argument byrow indicates that the matrix is filled by the rows. If we want the matrix to be filled by the columns, we just place byrow = FALSE.
The third argument nrow indicates that the matrix should have three rows.</code></pre>

<p>It is now time to get your hands dirty. In the following exercises you will analyze the box office numbers of the Star Wars franchise. May the force be with you!</p>
<p>In the editor, three vectors are defined. Each one represents the box office numbers from the first three Star Wars movies. The first element of each vector indicates the US box office revenue, the second element refers to the Non-US box office (source: Wikipedia).</p>
<p>In this exercise, you’ll combine all these figures into a single vector. Next, you’ll build a matrix from this vector.</p>

<p>To help you remember what is stored in star_wars_matrix, you would like to add the names of the movies for the rows. Not only does this help you to read the data, but it is also useful to select certain elements from the matrix.</p>
<p>Similar to vectors, you can add names for the rows and the columns of a matrix:</p>

<section id="calculating-the-worldwide-box-office" class="level1">
<h1>Calculating the worldwide box office</h1>
<p>The single most important thing for a movie in order to become an instant legend in Tinseltown is its worldwide box office figures.</p>
<p>To calculate the total box office revenue for the three Star Wars movies, you have to take the sum of the US revenue column and the non-US revenue column.</p>
<p>In R, the function rowSums() conveniently calculates the totals for each row of a matrix. This function creates a new vector: rowSums(my_matrix)</p>
<p>Adding a column for the Worldwide box office</p>
<p>In the previous exercise you calculated the vector that contained the worldwide box office receipt for each of the three Star Wars movies. However, this vector is not yet part of star_wars_matrix.</p>
<p>You can add a column or multiple columns to a matrix with the cbind() function, which merges matrices and/or vectors together by column. For example:</p>
<p>Nice job! After adding column to a matrix, the logical next step is adding rows. Learn how in the next exercise.</p>
</section>
<section id="adding-a-row" class="level1">
<h1>Adding a row</h1>
<p>Just like every action has a reaction, every cbind() has an rbind(). (We admit, we are pretty bad with metaphors.)</p>
<p>Your R workspace, where all variables you defined ‘live’ (check out what a workspace is), has already been initialized and contains two matrices:</p>
<pre><code>star_wars_matrix that we have used all along, with data on the original trilogy,
star_wars_matrix2, with similar data for the prequels trilogy. Explore these matrices in the console if you want to have a closer look. If you want to check out the contents of the workspace, you can type ls() in the console.</code></pre>

<section id="selection-of-matrix-elements" class="level1">
<h1>Selection of matrix elements</h1>
<p>Similar to vectors, you can use the square brackets [ ] to select one or multiple elements from a matrix. Whereas vectors have one dimension, matrices have two dimensions. You should therefore use a comma to separate the rows you want to select from the columns. For example:</p>
<pre><code>my_matrix[1,2] selects the element at the first row and second column.
my_matrix[1:3,2:4] results in a matrix with the data on the rows 1, 2, 3 and columns 2, 3, 4.</code></pre>
<p>If you want to select all elements of a row or a column, no number is needed before or after the comma, respectively:</p>
<pre><code>my_matrix[,1] selects all elements of the first column.
my_matrix[1,] selects all elements of the first row.</code></pre>

<p>It’s a fact: the R force is with you! This exercise concludes the chapter on matrices. Next stop on your journey through the R language: factors.</p>
<section id="whats-a-factor-and-why-would-you-use-it" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="whats-a-factor-and-why-would-you-use-it">What’s a factor and why would you use it?</h2>
<p>In this chapter you dive into the wonderful world of factors.</p>
<p>The term factor refers to a statistical data type used to store categorical variables. The difference between a categorical variable and a continuous variable is that a categorical variable can belong to a limited number of categories. A continuous variable, on the other hand, can correspond to an infinite number of values.</p>
<p>It is important that R knows whether it is dealing with a continuous or a categorical variable, as the statistical models you will develop in the future treat both types differently. (You will see later why this is the case.)</p>
<p>A good example of a categorical variable is sex. In many circumstances you can limit the sex categories to “Male” or “Female”. (Sometimes you may need different categories. For example, you may need to consider chromosomal variation, hermaphroditic animals, or different cultural norms, but you will always have a finite number of categories.)</p>
<p>What’s a factor and why would you use it? (2)</p>
<p>To create factors in R, you make use of the function factor(). First thing that you have to do is create a vector that contains all the observations that belong to a limited number of categories. For example, sex_vector contains the sex of 5 different individuals:</p>
<p>It is clear that there are two categories, or in R-terms ‘factor levels’, at work here: “Male” and “Female”.</p>
<p>The function factor() will encode the vector as a factor:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>[1] Male   Female Female Male   Male  
Levels: Female Male</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Great! If you want to find out more about the factor() function, do not hesitate to type ?factor in the console. This will open up a help page. Continue to the next exercise.</p>
<p>What’s a factor and why would you use it? (3)</p>
<p>There are two types of categorical variables: a nominal categorical variable and an ordinal categorical variable.</p>
<p>A nominal variable is a categorical variable without an implied order. This means that it is impossible to say that ‘one is worth more than the other’. For example, think of the categorical variable animals_vector with the categories “Elephant”, “Giraffe”, “Donkey” and “Horse”. Here, it is impossible to say that one stands above or below the other. (Note that some of you might disagree ;-) ).</p>
<p>In contrast, ordinal variables do have a natural ordering. Consider for example the categorical variable temperature_vector with the categories: “Low”, “Medium” and “High”. Here it is obvious that “Medium” stands above “Low”, and “High” stands above “Medium”.</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>[1] Elephant Giraffe  Donkey   Horse   
Levels: Donkey Elephant Giraffe Horse</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="cell">
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>[1] High   Low    High   Low    Medium
Levels: Low &lt; Medium &lt; High</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Can you already tell what’s happening in this exercise? Awesome! Continue to the next exercise and get into the details of factor levels.</p>
<p>Factor levels</p>
<p>When you first get a data set, you will often notice that it contains factors with specific factor levels. However, sometimes you will want to change the names of these levels for clarity or other reasons. R allows you to do this with the function levels():</p>
<p>levels(factor_vector) &lt;- c(“name1”, “name2”,…)</p>
<p>A good illustration is the raw data that is provided to you by a survey. A common question for every questionnaire is the sex of the respondent. Here, for simplicity, just two categories were recorded, “M” and “F”. (You usually need more categories for survey data; either way, you use a factor to store the categorical data.)</p>
<p>Recording the sex with the abbreviations “M” and “F” can be convenient if you are collecting data with pen and paper, but it can introduce confusion when analyzing the data. At that point, you will often want to change the factor levels to “Male” and “Female” instead of “M” and “F” for clarity.</p>
<p>Watch out: the order with which you assign the levels is important. If you type levels(factor_survey_vector), you’ll see that it outputs [1] “F” “M”. If you don’t specify the levels of the factor when creating the vector, R will automatically assign them alphabetically. To correctly map “F” to “Female” and “M” to “Male”, the levels should be set to c(“Female”, “Male”), in this order.</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>[1] Male   Female Female Male   Male  
Levels: Female Male</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Summarizing a factor</p>
<p>After finishing this course, one of your favorite functions in R will be summary(). This will give you a quick overview of the contents of a variable:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
      4       4       4       4       4       4 </code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Going back to our survey, you would like to know how many “Male” responses you have in your study, and how many “Female” responses. The summary() function gives you the answer to this question.</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>[1] Male   Female Female Male   Male  
Levels: Female Male</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="cell">
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>   Length     Class      Mode 
        5 character character </code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="cell">
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>Female   Male 
     2      3 </code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Nice! Have a look at the output. The fact that you identified “Male” and “Female” as factor levels in factor_survey_vector enables R to show the number of elements for each category.</p>
<p>Battle of the sexes</p>
<p>You might wonder what happens when you try to compare elements of a factor. In factor_survey_vector you have a factor with two levels: “Male” and “Female”. But how does R value these relative to each other?</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stderr">
<pre><code>Warning in Ops.factor(male, female): '&gt;' not meaningful for factors</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>[1] NA</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>How interesting! By default, R returns NA when you try to compare values in a factor, since the idea doesn’t make sense. Next you’ll learn about ordered factors, where more meaningful comparisons are possible.</p>
<p>Ordered factors</p>
<p>Since “Male” and “Female” are unordered (or nominal) factor levels, R returns a warning message, telling you that the greater than operator is not meaningful. As seen before, R attaches an equal value to the levels for such factors.</p>
<p>But this is not always the case! Sometimes you will also deal with factors that do have a natural ordering between its categories. If this is the case, we have to make sure that we pass this information to R…</p>
<p>Let us say that you are leading a research team of five data analysts and that you want to evaluate their performance. To do this, you track their speed, evaluate each analyst as “slow”, “medium” or “fast”, and save the results in speed_vector.</p>
<p>Ordered factors (2)</p>
<p>speed_vector should be converted to an ordinal factor since its categories have a natural ordering. By default, the function factor() transforms speed_vector into an unordered factor. To create an ordered factor, you have to add two additional arguments: ordered and levels</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>      Name Profession 
      &lt;NA&gt;       &lt;NA&gt; 
Levels: lev1 &lt; lev2</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>By setting the argument ordered to TRUE in the function factor(), you indicate that the factor is ordered. With the argument levels you give the values of the factor in the correct order.</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>[1] medium slow   slow   medium fast  
Levels: slow &lt; medium &lt; fast</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="cell">
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>  slow medium   fast 
     2      2      1 </code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Great! Have a look at the console. It is now indicated that the Levels indeed have an order associated, with the &lt; sign. Continue to the next exercise.</p>
<p>Comparing ordered factors</p>
<p>Having a bad day at work, ‘data analyst number two’ enters your office and starts complaining that ‘data analyst number five’ is slowing down the entire project. Since you know that ‘data analyst number two’ has the reputation of being a smarty-pants, you first decide to check if his statement is true.</p>
<p>The fact that factor_speed_vector is now ordered enables us to compare different elements (the data analysts in this case). You can simply do this by using the well-known operators.</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>[1] FALSE</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Bellissimo! What does the result tell you? Data analyst two is complaining about the data analyst five while in fact they are the one slowing everything down! This concludes the chapter on factors. With a solid basis in vectors, matrices and factors, you’re ready to dive into the wonderful world of data frames, a very important data structure in R!</p>
</section>
<section id="whats-a-data-frame" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="whats-a-data-frame">What’s a data frame?</h2>
<p>You may remember from the chapter about matrices that all the elements that you put in a matrix should be of the same type. Back then, your data set on Star Wars only contained numeric elements.</p>
<p>When doing a market research survey, however, you often have questions such as:</p>
<pre><code>‘Are you married?’ or ‘yes/no’ questions (logical)
‘How old are you?’ (numeric)
‘What is your opinion on this product?’ or other ‘open-ended’ questions (character)
…</code></pre>
<p>The output, namely the respondents’ answers to the questions formulated above, is a data set of different data types. You will often find yourself working with data sets that contain different data types instead of only one.</p>
<p>A data frame has the variables of a data set as columns and the observations as rows. This will be a familiar concept for those coming from different statistical software packages such as SAS or SPSS.</p>

<p>Quick, have a look at your data set</p>
<p>Wow, that is a lot of cars!</p>
<p>Working with large data sets is not uncommon in data analysis. When you work with (extremely) large data sets and data frames, your first task as a data analyst is to develop a clear understanding of its structure and main elements. Therefore, it is often useful to show only a small part of the entire data set.</p>
<p>So how to do this in R? Well, the function head() enables you to show the first observations of a data frame. Similarly, the function tail() prints out the last observations in your data set.</p>
<p>Both head() and tail() print a top line called the ‘header’, which contains the names of the different variables in your data set.</p>

<p>Wonderful! So, what do we have in this data set? For example, hp represents the car’s horsepower; the Datsun has the lowest horse power of the 6 cars that are displayed. For a full overview of the variables’ meaning, type ?mtcars in the console and read the help page. Continue to the next exercise!</p>
<p>Have a look at the structure</p>
<p>Another method that is often used to get a rapid overview of your data is the function str(). The function str() shows you the structure of your data set. For a data frame it tells you:</p>
<pre><code>The total number of observations (e.g. 32 car types)
The total number of variables (e.g. 11 car features)
A full list of the variables names (e.g. mpg, cyl … )
The data type of each variable (e.g. num)
The first observations</code></pre>
<p>Applying the str() function will often be the first thing that you do when receiving a new data set or data frame. It is a great way to get more insight in your data set before diving into the real analysis.</p>

<p>Creating a data frame</p>
<p>Since using built-in data sets is not even half the fun of creating your own data sets, the rest of this chapter is based on your personally developed data set. Put your jet pack on because it is time for some space exploration!</p>
<p>As a first goal, you want to construct a data frame that describes the main characteristics of eight planets in our solar system. According to your good friend Buzz, the main features of a planet are:</p>
<pre><code>The type of planet (Terrestrial or Gas Giant).
The planet’s diameter relative to the diameter of the Earth.
The planet’s rotation across the sun relative to that of the Earth.
If the planet has rings or not (TRUE or FALSE).</code></pre>
<p>After doing some high-quality research on Wikipedia, you feel confident enough to create the necessary vectors: name, type, diameter, rotation and rings; these vectors have already been coded up in the editor. The first element in each of these vectors correspond to the first observation.</p>
<p>You construct a data frame with the data.frame() function. As arguments, you pass the vectors from before: they will become the different columns of your data frame. Because every column has the same length, the vectors you pass should also have the same length. But don’t forget that it is possible (and likely) that they contain different types of data.</p>
<p>Great job! Continue to the next exercise. The logical next step, as you know by now, is inspecting the data frame you just created. Head over to the next exercise.</p>
<p>Creating a data frame (2)</p>
<p>The planets_df data frame should have 8 observations and 5 variables. It has been made available in the workspace, so you can directly use it.</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>'data.frame':   8 obs. of  5 variables:
 $ name    : chr  "Mercury" "Venus" "Earth" "Mars" ...
 $ type    : chr  "Terrestrial planet" "Terrestrial planet" "Terrestrial planet" "Terrestrial planet" ...
 $ diameter: num  0.382 0.949 1 0.532 11.209 ...
 $ rotation: num  58.64 -243.02 1 1.03 0.41 ...
 $ rings   : logi  FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE ...</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Awesome! Now that you have a clear understanding of the planets_df data set, it’s time to see how you can select elements from it. Learn all about in the next exercises!</p>
<p>Selection of data frame elements</p>
<p>Similar to vectors and matrices, you select elements from a data frame with the help of square brackets [ ]. By using a comma, you can indicate what to select from the rows and the columns respectively. For example:</p>
<pre><code>my_df[1,2] selects the value at the first row and second column in my_df.
my_df[1:3,2:4] selects rows 1, 2, 3 and columns 2, 3, 4 in my_df.</code></pre>
<p>Sometimes you want to select all elements of a row or column. For example, my_df[1, ] selects all elements of the first row. Let us now apply this technique on planets_df!</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>[1] 0.382</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="cell">
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>  name               type diameter rotation rings
4 Mars Terrestrial planet    0.532     1.03 FALSE</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Great! Apart from selecting elements from your data frame by index, you can also use the column names. To learn how, head over to the next exercise.</p>
<p>Selection of data frame elements (2)</p>
<p>Instead of using numerics to select elements of a data frame, you can also use the variable names to select columns of a data frame.</p>
<p>Suppose you want to select the first three elements of the type column. One way to do this is</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>[1] "Terrestrial planet" "Terrestrial planet" "Terrestrial planet"</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>A possible disadvantage of this approach is that you have to know (or look up) the column number of type, which gets hard if you have a lot of variables. It is often easier to just make use of the variable name:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>[1] "Terrestrial planet" "Terrestrial planet" "Terrestrial planet"</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>[1]  0.382  0.949  1.000  0.532 11.209</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Only planets with rings</p>
<p>You will often want to select an entire column, namely one specific variable from a data frame. If you want to select all elements of the variable diameter, for example, both of these will do the trick:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>[1]  0.382  0.949  1.000  0.532 11.209  9.449  4.007  3.883</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>[1]  0.382  0.949  1.000  0.532 11.209  9.449  4.007  3.883</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>However, there is a short-cut. If your columns have names, you can use the $ sign:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>[1]  0.382  0.949  1.000  0.532 11.209  9.449  4.007  3.883</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="cell">
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>[1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Great! Continue to the next exercise and discover yet another way of subsetting!</p>
<p>Only planets with rings (2)</p>
<p>You probably remember from high school that some planets in our solar system have rings and others do not. Unfortunately you can not recall their names. Could R help you out?</p>
<p>If you type rings_vector in the console, you get: [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE</p>
<p>This means that the first four observations (or planets) do not have a ring (FALSE), but the other four do (TRUE). However, you do not get a nice overview of the names of these planets, their diameter, etc. Let’s try to use rings_vector to select the data for the four planets with rings.</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>     name      type diameter rotation rings
5 Jupiter Gas giant   11.209     0.41  TRUE
6  Saturn Gas giant    9.449     0.43  TRUE
7  Uranus Gas giant    4.007    -0.72  TRUE
8 Neptune Gas giant    3.883     0.67  TRUE</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Wonderful! This is a rather tedious solution. The next exercise will teach you how to do it in a more concise way.</p>
<p>Only planets with rings but shorter</p>
<p>So what exactly did you learn in the previous exercises? You selected a subset from a data frame (planets_df) based on whether or not a certain condition was true (rings or no rings), and you managed to pull out all relevant data. Pretty awesome! By now, NASA is probably already flirting with your CV ;-).</p>
<p>Now, let us move up one level and use the function subset(). You should see the subset() function as a short-cut to do exactly the same as what you did in the previous exercises.</p>
<p>The first argument of subset() specifies the data set for which you want a subset. By adding the second argument, you give R the necessary information and conditions to select the correct subset.</p>
<p>The code below will give the exact same result as you got in the previous exercise, but this time, you didn’t need the rings_vector</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>     name      type diameter rotation rings
5 Jupiter Gas giant   11.209     0.41  TRUE
6  Saturn Gas giant    9.449     0.43  TRUE
7  Uranus Gas giant    4.007    -0.72  TRUE
8 Neptune Gas giant    3.883     0.67  TRUE</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="cell">
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>     name               type diameter rotation rings
1 Mercury Terrestrial planet    0.382    58.64 FALSE
2   Venus Terrestrial planet    0.949  -243.02 FALSE
4    Mars Terrestrial planet    0.532     1.03 FALSE</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Great! Not only is the subset() function more concise, it is probably also more understandable for people who read your code. Continue to the next exercise.</p>
<p>Sorting</p>
<p>Making and creating rankings is one of mankind’s favorite affairs. These rankings can be useful (best universities in the world), entertaining (most influential movie stars) or pointless (best 007 look-a-like).</p>
<p>In data analysis you can sort your data according to a certain variable in the data set. In R, this is done with the help of the function order().</p>
<p>order() is a function that gives you the ranked position of each element when it is applied on a variable, such as a vector for example:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>[1] 2 1 3</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>10, which is the second element in a, is the smallest element, so 2 comes first in the output of order(a). 100, which is the first element in a is the second smallest element, so 1 comes second in the output of order(a).</p>
<p>This means we can use the output of order(a) to reshuffle a:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>[1]   10  100 1000</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Great! Now let’s use the order() function to sort your data frame!</p>
<p>Sorting your data frame</p>
<p>Alright, now that you understand the order() function, let us do something useful with it. You would like to rearrange your data frame such that it starts with the smallest planet and ends with the largest one. A sort on the diameter column.</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>     name               type diameter rotation rings
1 Mercury Terrestrial planet    0.382    58.64 FALSE
4    Mars Terrestrial planet    0.532     1.03 FALSE
2   Venus Terrestrial planet    0.949  -243.02 FALSE
3   Earth Terrestrial planet    1.000     1.00 FALSE
8 Neptune          Gas giant    3.883     0.67  TRUE
7  Uranus          Gas giant    4.007    -0.72  TRUE
6  Saturn          Gas giant    9.449     0.43  TRUE
5 Jupiter          Gas giant   11.209     0.41  TRUE</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Wonderful! This exercise concludes the chapter on data frames. Remember that data frames are extremely important in R, you will need them all the time. Another very often used data structure is the list. This will be the subject of the next chapter!</p>
<p>Lists, why would you need them?</p>
<p>Congratulations! At this point in the course you are already familiar with:</p>
<pre><code>Vectors (one dimensional array): can hold numeric, character or logical values. The elements in a vector all have the same data type.
Matrices (two dimensional array): can hold numeric, character or logical values. The elements in a matrix all have the same data type.
Data frames (two-dimensional objects): can hold numeric, character or logical values. Within a column all elements have the same data type, but different columns can be of different data type.</code></pre>
<p>Pretty sweet for an R newbie, right? ;-)</p>
<p>Lists, why would you need them? (2)</p>
<p>A list in R is similar to your to-do list at work or school: the different items on that list most likely differ in length, characteristic, and type of activity that has to be done.</p>
<p>A list in R allows you to gather a variety of objects under one name (that is, the name of the list) in an ordered way. These objects can be matrices, vectors, data frames, even other lists, etc. It is not even required that these objects are related to each other in any way.</p>
<p>You could say that a list is some kind super data type: you can store practically any piece of information in it!</p>
<p>Creating a list</p>
<p>Let us create our first list! To construct a list you use the function list():</p>
<p>The arguments to the list function are the list components. Remember, these components can be matrices, vectors, other lists, …</p>
<p>Creating a named list</p>
<p>Well done, you’re on a roll!</p>
<p>Just like on your to-do list, you want to avoid not knowing or remembering what the components of your list stand for. That is why you should give names to them:</p>
<p>This creates a list with components that are named name1, name2, and so on. If you want to name your lists after you’ve created them, you can use the names() function as you did with vectors. The following commands are fully equivalent to the assignment above:</p>
<p>my_list &lt;- list(your_comp1, your_comp2) names(my_list) &lt;- c(“name1”, “name2”)</p>

<p>Being a huge movie fan (remember your job at LucasFilms), you decide to start storing information on good movies with the help of lists.</p>
<p>Start by creating a list for the movie “The Shining”. We have already created the variables mov, act and rev in your R workspace. Feel free to check them out in the console.</p>
<p>Selecting elements from a list</p>
<p>Your list will often be built out of numerous elements and components. Therefore, getting a single element, multiple elements, or a component out of it is not always straightforward.</p>
<p>One way to select a component is using the numbered position of that component. For example, to “grab” the first component of shining_list you type</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>[1] "The Shining"</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>A quick way to check this out is typing it in the console. Important to remember: to select elements from vectors, you use single square brackets: [ ]. Don’t mix them up!</p>
<p>You can also refer to the names of the components, with [[ ]] or with the $ sign. Both will select the data frame representing the reviews:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>  scores sources                                              comments
1    4.5   IMDb1                     Best Horror Film I Have Ever Seen
2    4.0   IMDb2 A truly brilliant and scary film from Stanley Kubrick
3    5.0   IMDb3                 A masterpiece of psychological horror</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>  scores sources                                              comments

3    5.0   IMDb3                 A masterpiece of psychological horror</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Besides selecting components, you often need to select specific elements out of these components. For example, with shining_list[[2]][1] you select from the second component, actors (shining_list[[2]]), the first element ([1]). When you type this in the console, you will see the answer is Jack Nicholson.</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>[1] "Jack Nicholson"   "Shelley Duvall"   "Danny Lloyd"      "Scatman Crothers"
[5] "Barry Nelson"    </code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="cell">
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>[1] "Shelley Duvall"</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Creating a new list for another movie</p>
<p>You found reviews of another, more recent, Jack Nicholson movie: The Departed! Scores Comments 4.6 I would watch it again 5 Amazing! 4.8 I liked it 5 One of the best movies 4.2 Fascinating plot</p>
<p>It would be useful to collect together all the pieces of information about the movie, like the title, actors, and reviews into a single variable. Since these pieces of data are different shapes, it is natural to combine them in a list variable.</p>
<p>movie_title, containing the title of the movie, and movie_actors, containing the names of some of the actors in the movie, are available in your workspace.</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>[[1]]
[1] "The Departed"

[[2]]
[1] "Leonardo DiCaprio" "Matt Damon"        "Jack Nicholson"   
[4] "Mark Wahlberg"     "Vera Farmiga"      "Martin Sheen"
